/**
 * @author Jake McKenzie
 * 
 * This was the third assignment for TCSS 341-Data Structures.
 * I worked alone this assignment. In the assignment we 
 * developed huffman trees for compressing famous works of literature.
 * 
 * The books I used for testing and my thought process for choosing them:
 * 
 * 1. War and Peace - This was the required text for compression. It is
 * a long text and showcases the compression technique well. I consider compression
 * of this text to be the baseline to meet. If I can hit this then I will test on
 * progressively harder texts to compress and decompress.
 * 
 * 2. The Story of Gosta Berling - This was written by the first women nobel
 * laureate. It is a swedish novel translated into english and should allow
 * for more range of UTF-8 characters to test from. This is more modern swedish
 * that has been translated to english so it should be harder to compress and decompress.
 * 
 * 3. Epic of Gilgamesh - This is an epic from ancient mesopotamia that is a 
 * story of the unbreakable friendship of Gilgamesh and Enkidu. This 
 * text includes tablets with weird spacing mostly translated into ond english. 
 * It offers different challenges in testing to The Story of Gosta Berling. 
 * It does not have as large a range of UTF-8 characters but it does offer 
 * spacing constraints. This text is shorter than War and Peace and allows 
 * to be ran more often in testing.
 * 
 * 4. Os Maias - A portuguese satirical comedy. This book is in the original
 * portuguese, as such it offers a wide range of possible UTF-8 characters 
 * to be compressed. This should be, theoretically, one of the hardger texts 
 * to compress due to it being in portuguese. This text is nearly as long as War 
 * and Peace but due to it being written in a romantic language is quite varied
 * despite that length.
 * https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/2998/do-most-languages-need-more-space-than-english/3022#3022
 * 
 * 5. The Valsung Saga - an icelandic saga that inspired Tolkein and Andrew 
 * Lang. This book was translated fairly recently into english and was 
 * included due to the songs included. I'm using this mostly to test for spacing
 * and add variety to the testing as it uses a wide array of UTF-8 and 
 * includes a lot of spacing.
 * 
 * All of these books happen to be on my current to read pile.
